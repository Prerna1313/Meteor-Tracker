## Core Features:

- Scalable Solar System Visualization: Display a 3D model of the solar system using Three.js, Cesium.js, and D3.js. Allow the user to zoom, rotate, and scale the view to explore asteroids and meteors.
- Object Labeling: Label celestial objects, asteroids, and meteors with their names for easy identification within the solar system visualization.
- Clickable Objects with Information Popup: Enable users to click on any celestial object (planets, asteroids, meteors) to trigger a popup displaying detailed information, like which meteors orbit the selected planet.
- Data Population Tool: Develop a tool (potentially utilizing an AI model) to determine and populate meteor and asteroid data and trajectory based on existing datasets.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark navy blue (#0B192F), providing contrast to bright celestial objects.
- Primary color: Luminous yellow (#FFFF8F) for the Sun, and the same hue for some labels, drawing attention to it as the focal point.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) to highlight selectable asteroids/meteors and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif suitable for UI elements and labels.
- Simple, flat icons for controls (zoom, rotate, info) to maintain a clean and modern aesthetic.
- Overlay popup window for object information with a clean and readable layout.
- Smooth transitions and animations for solar system rotation and object selection to enhance user experience.
